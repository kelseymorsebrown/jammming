Implement Saving the Playlist to a User's Account

Jammming's main feature is allowing users to export their created playlist and save it to their personal Spotify account. Implement a feature to save a user's playlist to their Spotify account and reset the existing playlist on the web app.

As a part of this goal, you should access a track property named uri. Spotify uses this field to reference tracks in the Spotify library. You should create an array containing the uri of each track in the playlist.

At this point, you don't need to interact with the Spotify API quite yet. Use mock data to test your implementation.

It's important to familiarize yourself with the Spotify API documentation to gain a clear understanding of how Spotify's uris works. For testing purposes, you can create a hardcoded array of uri values. To obtain a Spotify uri, simply right-click (on Windows) or ctrl-click (on Mac) on a song's name.
