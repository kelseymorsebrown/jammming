# Next Step

Implement Track Listing in The Component Tree

When a user requests data from Spotify, the JSON response will contain a set of song tracks. Your Jammming web app should display the song name, artist, and album for each track in the results list.

Implement this by creating a unidirectional data flow from your root component. The root component should pass down the search results to a child component that will return each individual track to be rendered.

Since the Spotify API is not currently set up to be called, you may hard-code an array of track objects to be passed down for now.

Things to keep in mind:

- Each hard-coded array of track objects should contain a name, artist, album, and id property.
- Consider using state to store information such as your search results array, allowing you to update the array in response to user inputs and other events.
- Use JavaScript's map() method to iterate over arrays and render multiple components dynamically.
- When returning the list of tracks, make sure to set a unique key attribute for each track. This will help React efficiently update the DOM when changes occur.
