# Next Step

Test often and test early. Testing frequently during the development process can help you identify issues and bugs sooner, making them easier and less time-consuming to fix. Wrap up your project by testing and debugging each component.

- Identify the components and functionalities of your project that need to be tested.
- Create test cases
- Execute the test cases
- Identify any issues or bugs that need to be fixed
- Implement your fix and perform a final test to ensure that all components and functionalities of your project are working as expected
